# odin-recipes
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

In this first project, I will use all the html knowledge that I have learned throughout The Odin Project Course html basics. During this basics course, I've learned some HTML elements like meta, paragraphs, headers, absolute and relative links and image paths, body and head elements.
